      <h1>Java Wordle Solver</h1>
      <p>
        This is my **fast** and **efficient** Wordle solver in Java.  
        It replaces my old **Python** <small>(more like Slowthon, am I right?)</small> solver <small>(which is also available on this page)</small>, which was ok but way too sluggish.  
        Now, we're talking **optimized data structures, precomputed values and instant results**.
