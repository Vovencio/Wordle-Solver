      <h1>Java Wordle Solver</h1>
      <p>
        This is my <b>fast and efficient Wordle solver</b> in Java. <br>
        It replaces my old Python <sub>(more like Slowthon, am I right?)</sub> solver, which was ok but way too sluggish. <sub>(it's also available on this page)</sub><br>
        Now, we're talking optimized data structures, precomputed values and near instant results.
