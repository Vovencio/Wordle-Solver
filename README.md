      <h1>Java Wordle Solver</h1>
      <p>
        This is my fast and efficient Wordle solver in Java. <br>
        It replaces my old Python <small>(more like Slowthon, am I right?)</small> solver <small>(which is also available on this page)</small>, which was ok but way too sluggish. <br>
        Now, we're talking optimized data structures, precomputed values and instant results**. <br>
